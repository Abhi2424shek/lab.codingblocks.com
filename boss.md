title: BOSS - Bountiful Open Source Summer
permalink: /boss/
---


At **Coding Blocks**, most of us come from a vibrant _Open Source_ Community,
and that makes us strongly believe in free and open source software.

Each year we teach hundreds of students coding, programming and software
development. Over the past three years (we started off in April 2014), we
have helped more than 1500 students gain expertise in Android, Web, Data Science
and more.

To be able to stay connected with our alumni, and reach out the wider
community of budding software developers, we are launching an annual summer
programme  - **BOSS** which stands for _**Bountiful Open Source Summer**_

We're inspiration from other such open source summer programmes like
_Google Summer of Code_, _Google Code-In_, _Summer of KDE_, _RGSoC_ and
many others.

# How will it work ?

At Coding Blocks we have a number of open source projects going on
which on can find here -
