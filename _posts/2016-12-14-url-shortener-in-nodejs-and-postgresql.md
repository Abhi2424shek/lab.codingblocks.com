The URL shortner project - _**shortlr**_ works like common URL shortening services like
<http://bit.ly> or <http://goo.gl> etc.    

People can -   
- Create shortcodes for their URLs (which are randomly generated 5 digit alphanumeric)  
- Create custom shortcodes (like /mycode) for their URLs  
 
There would be stats available for how many times each shortlink has been
opened. Also the traffic stats will have details of the referrer URL 
(which gives information on where the traffic is comming from).
